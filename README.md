# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for MNIST Digits
This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate MNIST digit images using PyTorch. The GAN consists of a Generator and a Discriminator, which are trained adversarially: the Generator tries to create realistic images, while the Discriminator attempts to distinguish between real and fake images.
## Project Details
The notebook performs the following steps:

- Data Loading and Preprocessing: Loads the MNIST dataset and preprocesses it by padding and normalizing the images.
- Visualization Function: Defines a function to visualize the images.
- Model Definition: Defines the Generator and Discriminator classes using convolutional and transposed convolutional layers.
- Training: Trains the GAN on the MNIST training data for a specified number of epochs, minimizing the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss.
- Visualization: Visualizes the generated images during and after training.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you need the following packages:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maryamjbr/GAN.git
cd GAN
```

2. Run the Python script:

```bash
python GAN.py
```

## Results
The training process will generate various output images and loss plots. The images generated by the Generator at different training steps will be saved in the results/ directory. Loss values for both the Generator and Discriminator will also be saved and plotted.
